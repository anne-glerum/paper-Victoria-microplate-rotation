This repository belongs to the paper

Glerum et al. (in review) Why does Victoria rotate? Continental microplate dynamics in numerical models of the East African Rift System.

and contains the input files (prms) to the ASPECT code used to compute the model results in the paper.

The input files correspond to the ASPECT branch paper-Victoria-microplate-rotation that can be found at

https://github.com/anne-glerum/aspect/tree/paper-Victoria-microplate-rotation

This branch stems from 2.0.0-pre commit 31a88da and includes changes to a.o. the files:

include/aspect/particle/particle_handler.h
include/aspect/postprocess/point_values.h
include/aspect/simulator_access.h
source/particle/particle_handler.cc
source/particle/world.cc
source/postprocess/point_values.cc
source/simulator/core.cc
source/simulator/simulator_access.cc

It also includes custom plugins needed for model setup and postprocessing:

include/aspect/geometry_model/initial_topography_model/lithosphere_rift.h
include/aspect/initial_composition/lithosphere_rift.h
include/aspect/initial_temperature/lithosphere_rift.h
include/aspect/material_model/visco_plastic_strain.h
include/aspect/mesh_refinement/lithosphere_rift.h
include/aspect/postprocess/visualization/stress_regime.h
source/geometry_model/initial_topography_model/lithosphere_rift.cc
source/initial_composition/lithosphere_rift.cc
source/initial_temperature/lithosphere_rift.cc
source/material_model/visco_plastic_strain.cc
source/mesh_refinement/lithosphere_rift.cc
source/postprocess/visualization/stress_regime.cc

The file prms/README_prms_to_paper_model_names contains a table linking
prm file names to the model names in the paper.
